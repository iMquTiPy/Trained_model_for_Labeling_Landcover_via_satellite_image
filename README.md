# Trained_model_for_Labeling_Landcover_via_satellite_image

Details:-

Made a trained model using Pytorch to predict the Landscape type and classify them into 7 categories:- 

'urban_land', 'agriclture_land', 'grass', 'tree', 'water', 'plain_land', 'unknown'

The data set used for this project was a satellite image of a Sentinal-2 satellite.

All the process of making the project is available on GitHub link provided above.

Results:-

Results based on the validation data I had gathered are as follows -> best IoU score of 72 percent and dice loss of 20 percent. This means the model was successfully able to predict the images from satellite and classify them into the category they fall in there were 7 categories used which were:- 'urban_land', 'agriclture_land', 'grass', 'tree', 'water', 'plain_land', 'unknown'. The graphs for IoU score and Dice loss are available on the GitHub repo for which the link is provided above.
